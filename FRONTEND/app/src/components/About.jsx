              Food is a basic necessity of life that provides the energy and
              nutrients required for the body to function, grow, and repair
              itself. It is more than just sustenanceâ€”it is also deeply tied to
              culture, tradition, economy, and identity. From simple home-cooked
              meals to elaborate international cuisines, food reflects the
              history and values of communities around the world. There are
              three main macronutrients in food: carbohydrates, proteins, and
              fats. Carbohydrates provide a quick source of energy and are found
              in grains, fruits, and vegetables. Proteins, found in meat, dairy,
              legumes, and nuts, are essential for building and repairing body
              tissues.
